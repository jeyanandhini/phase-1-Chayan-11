### <p align="center"> ðŸ”¶ðŸ”¸ Hearing it out from the voice of Dr. Shashi Tharoor ðŸ”¹ðŸ”· </p>

-------------------------------------------------------------------


- [X] **Not often do we get to seek such opportunities to meet some iconic celebs but today marked the day,
where I got a chance to share a virtual stage with Dr. Shashi Tharoor and other principal members from various fields and professions.**

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### <p align="center"> ðŸ“š Here, are some of the learnings I could gather from the sessions:- </p>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

> * **Not everyone of us gets the privelege to study from the best of the schools or colleges but we can still open our learning scope to an extent that we get to cover the missing jigsaw puzzles in our development. Dr. Tharoor had the privelege as well as monetary and mental support from his parents which helped him in long run to become a better speaker as he mentioned that they use to have eloquitions, debates and learning culture which helped him in his exponential learning curve.**

> * **One of the major key points he mentioned was that he started young and he practiced thoroughly and maintained consistency in his learning process. Mastering a skill requires consistency with patience and that's not a game of day or two.**

> * **If we feel like we lag in some skills we eventually can ponder on some well defined resources or can catchup by following others to excel in something.**

> * **One of the key points which Dr. Tharoor mentioned was *Effective Communication* is the single most asset in any profession! The art of articulating your ideas to others in a form which compelles them is itself valued and is one of the highest and toughest thing to do.**

> * **Having the ability to marshall your thoughts and using them coherently to actually persuade others mind to change or convince their opinions align with yours is one of the toughest and most demanding skill you can cater for.**

> * **Always remember your own authenticity and integrity is one of the fundamentals and without it effective communication is futile.**
