👉 Important Takeaways for future presentations:- 

a) Most Imporatant feature of speech delivery is Voice Modulation, 
   so record yourself in different tones (sad, excited, flat, high, irritated, etc) and try to improvize accordingly while preparing for speeches
b) Since due to ongoing situation of pandemic, it's going to be virtual proceedings for sometime now, so while presenting ourselves we can stand 
   and deliver our speeches since hand gestures and facial expressions weighs alot and gives an extra edge to our speech delivery
c) Place your camera at a good angle and make sure to have a good wifi so that external factors can be cutoff from disrupting our speeches
d) Make sure not to use filler words (like ughh, umm, ahh, you know, etc) and repetitive words while presenting
e) Most importantly listen to the speakers and note important takeaways from their talks. "A good Speaker is first a good Listener"
