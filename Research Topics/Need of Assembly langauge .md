### <p align="center"> ‚è≥ What is Assembly language ? </p>
----------------------------------------------------------

* **Assembly is a human readable machine language, which is considered as an intermediate language that C compiler uses while compiling C codes.**

* **Basically it takes in the C codes, compiles it to Assembly instructions and then assembler converts it into Binary Machine instructions which our computer understands.**

* **The first assembly language was developed in 1947 by Kathleen Booth for the ARC2 at Birkbeck, 
University of London following work with John von Neumann and Herman Goldstine at the Institute for Advanced Study.**

### <p align="center"> ‚≠ê Significance of Assembly Language </p>
----------------------------------------------------------

* **It comes handy when you're trying to make sense out of any mistake or abnormal feature in programming behaviour.**

* **It also helps when you're trying to understand a program that doesn't have any source code and that too obviously for legal purposes.**

* **It is time efficient, consumes less memory and also helpful in Hardware Manipulation & Processor Instructions.**

### <p align="center"> ü§î Why should we learn Assembly language? </p>
---------------------------------------------------------

* **Learning the Assembly Language is quintessential for programmers.**
* **Once they learn the language, they will be able to write codes to access registers and easily retrieve memory addresses of printers and values by learning Assembly Language thoroughly.**
* **Despite the prevalence of high-level languages, which are mainly used for developing applications & software, the importance of Assembly Language in today‚Äôs world is highly underestimated.**
* **Undoubtedly, a programmer can gain a lot if he/she learns to code in Assembly Language and implement as and when required.**
* **The main uses of Assembly Language Programming include:- Coding device drivers, real-time systems, reverse engineering and more.**
* **One of the major benefits of learning Assembly Language is it helps in manipulating the hardware directly.**
* **It manages critical issues when it comes to hampered performance and proffers access to special instructions for processors.**
