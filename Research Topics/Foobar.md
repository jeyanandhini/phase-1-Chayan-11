### ‚óº What does FooBar mean?

‚úî**FooBar is a slang used in the IT world as a placeholder to refer to generic examples or programs that are to be deleted.**

‚úî**The technical term for a word like foobar is a metasyntactic variable.**

‚úî**These types of terms are used to name variables, programs or other parts of code.**


### ‚óº Explanation :-

* **A placeholder usually plays a role in situations where a programmer or developer may need to name a variable or other item, but may not have a name in mind.**

* **Where naming becomes extremely arbitrary, developers have come up with convenient defaults.**

* **One of these is foobar. Another is "foo", the first syllable of foobar, where bar is used as a second placeholder.**
 
* **So a temporary file may be named foobar.txt, foobar.jpg, etc.**
 
* **It‚Äôs important not to confuse foobar with a similar term, fubar, which developed in the U.S. military.**
 
* **Fubar describes a chaotic and problematic situation; fubar has not such connotation in IT.**

* **It‚Äôs also useful to note that although foobar is an arbitrary placeholder.**

* **It has become popular enough to be used in naming some technologies, such as foobar2000, a freeware audio player for Windows.**
