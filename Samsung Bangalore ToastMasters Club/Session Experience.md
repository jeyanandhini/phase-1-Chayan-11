📌 My first ever ToastMaster session experience in Samsung Bangalore club

👉 General rules for any ToastMaster session remains the same like not talking about taboo topics (politics, religion, sex, etc)
👉 Donot unmute yourself while the speakers or EC members present their speeches 
👉 Make sure to turn on the camera throughout the session if your network bandwith allows you to do so
👉 Make sure to call the members by the prefix "ToastMaster" followed by their respective names

📌 My Learnings and Takeaways:- 

👉 The biggest takeaway from this session was to improve on Impromptu speaking and be much more confident infront of the camera to face senior leaders of the industry.
👉 It's never easy as it seems to be (not a cherry on top on cake in this case atleast) and requires loads of practice as it's Incertitude and we only expect the unexpected!
👉 Commmunication certainly isn't just a child's game which happens overnight as it requires every bit of your presence of mind and IQ to be working on that instant moment.
👉 Rounds like Table Topics test your presence of mind and approach towards a cetain thing which eventually comes by practice and not just by reading textbooks.
👉 Three important things to keep in mind as a student are:- Networking, Technical skills, Communication skills can either make it big for you or shatter it in a second!
👉 Although I was given a second chance to present myself inspite of time constraints was just a pure act of genorosity from one of the session evaluators, we all know second 
   chance are totally uncertain and we may not even get anymore chance to present ourselves. But that must not stop ourselves from fighting back and finding a correct rhythmic 
   approach.
👉 Messing up on first attempts has been one of my bad habits from childhood which may not be the case with many people but I just make sure to takeway the learnings and flaws 
   I find in me while doing anything which will surely help me in long run.
👉 Being a little less nrevous is also one of the things I need to improve on because it's got to get common to meet new people and any senior leaders of Industry and messing up
   infront of them in first meet would be the last thing anybody would think about.
👉 Out of those three pillars which needs to kept in mind, I firstly think Communication is the utmost priority of mine and must get more use to various adaptations, to make 
   the most out of me and infact everything happens in the course of long time of investment, so we need to be more practical oriented rather than dreaming about "FAANG"!
