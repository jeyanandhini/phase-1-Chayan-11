## <p align="center"> 💭 Pointers Concepts </p>

* **We can perform arithmetic operations on the pointers like addition, subtraction, etc.** 
* **However, as we know that pointer contains the address, the result of an arithmetic operation performed on the pointer will also be a pointer if the other operand is of type integer.**
* **In pointer-from-pointer subtraction, the result will be an integer value.**

**♦ Following arithmetic operations are possible on the pointer in C language:-**

* Increment
* Decrement
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Comparison
