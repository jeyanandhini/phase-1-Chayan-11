## Learnings and Takeaways

* **The biggest takeaway from this session was to improve on *Impromptu speaking and be much more confident infront of the camera* to face senior leaders of the industry.**

* **It's *never easy as it seems to be* (not a cherry on top of cake in this case atleast) and requires loads of practice as it's Incertitude and we only expect the unexpected !**

* **Commmunication certainly isn't just a child's game which happens overnight as it *requires every bit of your presence of mind and IQ* to be working on that instant moment.**

* **Rounds like Table Topics test your *presence of mind and approach towards a certain illustration* which eventually comes by practice and not just by reading textbooks.**

* **Three important things to keep in mind as a student are:- *Networking, Technical skills, Communication skills* can either make it big for you or shatter it in a second !**

* **Although I was given a second chance to present myself inspite of time constraints as I failed to speak on a topic in first attempt, which was just a pure act of generosity    from one of the session evaluators, we all know *chances are totally uncertain to prove oneself* and we must be ready on the first go !**   
   
* **Messing up on first attempts has been one of my bad habit-cum-trait from childhood which may not be the case with many people but I just make sure to takeway the             learnings and flaws I find in me while doing anything which I believe will surely help me in long run.**
   
* **Being a *little less nervous* is also one of the things I need to improve on because it's got to get common to meet new people and any senior leaders of Industry and messing 
    up infront of them in first meet would be the last thing anybody would think about.**
   
* **Out of those three pillars which needs to kept in mind, I firstly think *Communication* is the utmost priority of mine and must get more use to various adaptations, to make 
   the most out of me and infact everything happens in the course of long time of investment, so we need to be more practical oriented rather than dreaming stuffs !**
